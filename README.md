## Overview
This study investigates the relationship between length of U.S. residency and depression among immigrants aged 30-60 years, utilizing data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression is measured through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The primary aim is to assess whether individuals who have lived in the U.S. for over five years face a higher risk of depression compared to recent arrivals (≤5 years). This research also examines how socioeconomic status (SES) and age interact with the duration of residency to influence depression levels.

## Research Problem
Immigrants in the U.S. often experience unique stressors—such as language barriers, cultural differences, and social isolation—that can affect their mental health. This study explores whether these acculturation-related challenges intensify over time, increasing the risk of depression. The research seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Is there a significant association between the length of U.S. residency and depression among adults aged 30-60?
2. How does socioeconomic status (income and education) influence the relationship between residency length and depression?
3. Does age modify the effect of residency length on depression risk?
4. The hypothesis posits that individuals with shorter residency durations (≤5 years) will report lower depression levels than those who have lived in the U.S. longer. SES is expected to act as a confounding variable, while age may serve as a moderating factor.

### Data and Methods

This analysis uses data from NHANES 2017-2020, focusing on 4,664 participants aged 30-60 years. Depression is measured using the PHQ-9, a standardized tool widely employed in clinical research. The primary exposure is the self-reported length of U.S. residency, categorized into two groups: ≤5 years and >5 years. Covariates include gender, race/ethnicity, education, and family income as a ratio to the poverty level.

### Statistical Analysis

   - Descriptive Analysis: Frequency and percentage distributions are used for categorical variables, such as education and age groups, while means and standard deviations describe continuous variables like income and PHQ-9 scores.
   - Bivariable Analysis: Chi-square tests compare categorical data, and t-tests assess continuous variables. Pearson’s correlation examines associations between residency length and depression.
   - Multivariable Analysis: Logistic and linear regression models adjust for covariates to estimate the relationship between residency length and depression. Socioeconomic status is treated as a confounder, and age is analyzed as a potential effect modifier by stratifying participants into two age groups: 30-44 years and 45-60 years.

## Results

In the adjusted linear regression model, individuals who had lived in the U.S. for more than five years showed significantly higher depression scores (β=1.52, p<0.001) than those with shorter residency. Lower education levels and poverty were also associated with increased depression scores. Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals with more than five years of U.S. residency had 33% higher odds of depression (OR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75) compared to recent immigrants.

## Discussion

Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the findings indicate that longer U.S. residency is associated with higher depression levels. These results align with previous research suggesting that the cumulative stress of acculturation and socioeconomic challenges can exacerbate mental health risks over time. The study also highlights the significant role of income and education as confounding factors, with poverty contributing to heightened depression risk. The stratified analysis showed that younger participants (30-44 years) experienced higher depression levels than their older counterparts (45-60 years), suggesting that age moderates the relationship between residency and mental health outcomes.

The findings emphasize the complex interaction between immigration, socioeconomic factors, and mental health, calling attention to the need for targeted mental health interventions tailored to immigrant populations.

### Limitations
This study is subject to several limitations.

1. Cross-Sectional Design: Causal relationships cannot be established due to the study's observational nature.
2. Self-Reporting Bias: Depression and residency data are self-reported, which may introduce reporting errors or bias.
3. Residual Confounding: Unmeasured factors such as social support networks, discrimination experiences, and cultural integration may influence depression outcomes.
4. Selection Bias: Systematic differences between NHANES participants and non-participants may affect the generalizability of results.

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. Longitudinal Studies: Future research should employ longitudinal designs to better capture the temporal relationship between residency duration and depression.
2. Qualitative Analysis: Incorporating qualitative methods could provide deeper insights into immigrants' lived experiences and the challenges they face over time.
3. Examine Mediators and Moderators: Studies should explore the potential roles of social support, discrimination, and cultural identity as mediators or moderators of the residency-depression relationship.
4. Culturally Responsive Interventions: Mental health services tailored to the specific needs of immigrant populations are essential for mitigating the psychological toll of acculturation.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that longer U.S. residency is associated with increased depression risk among immigrants aged 30-60, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of acculturation processes and socioeconomic disparities. The findings underscore the importance of developing culturally appropriate mental health interventions and addressing economic inequalities to support the well-being of long-term immigrants.
